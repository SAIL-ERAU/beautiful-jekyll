### Satellite illumination

Because of their altitude, satellites and debris in Earth orbit are illuminated by the sun even after it sets for observers on the ground. During this brief period of time after sunset and before sunrise, sun light reflecting off resident space objects (RSOs) makes them visible against the dark background sky. Each physical feature of a spacecraft contributes to the observed brightness and potentially convolves spectral information into the reflected light. If the illumination geometry and satellite shape is known, the attitude of a spacecraft can be partially determined by identifying the peak of mirror-like specular reflections which follow Newton's Law of Reflection. This condition is met when a satellite facet normal is aligned with the phase angle bisector (PAB) midway between the satellite-to-sun and satellite-to-observer vectors.

### OSCOM's research goals

By interpreting the optical and spectral features of resident space objects (RSOs), OSCOM is attempting to estimate physical parameters that describe the object: spin rate, deployable status, material makeup and degradation, attitude, etc. Such information can then be used to characterize, categorize, and monitor uncontrolled or unknown space objects, as well as independently provide diagnostic information for operational satellites, big or small.

Although OSCOM specializes in small satellites and CubeSats in low Earth orbit (LEO), the project team also develops observational and analysis techniques for solving Space Situational Awareness (SSA) problems with spatially resolved satellites in LEO, satellites in GEO, and debris and near Earth asteroids.

### Past and present research activities include:

- Robust photometry, spectroscopy, and orbit determination  
- Spacecraft attitude determination and multi-site simultaneous observational  
- Mining and heuristic analysis of large datasets  
- Telescope and detector characterization and tracking system design  
- Lucky/speckle imaging and deconvolution methods for high resolution imaging  
- CubeSat design and ground truth optical characterization
