OSCOM is fortunate to have a selection of equipment available at hand in Daytona Beach, FL to provide the right tool to meet particular observation needs.

### PlaneWave CDK20

The CDK20 is a 0.5 meter Corrected Dall-Kirkham telescope. The 20 inch diameter primary mirror is the ideal size for spatially resolved observations of large LEO satellites. It provides a good balance of better diffraction limit over smaller telescopes without being so large that atmospheric scintillation prohibits clear images. Being f/6.8, it is optically faster than most telescopes this size, meaning it is also suited to observe fairly dim targets.

### DFM 1 meter

The [Embry-Riddle Daytona Beach Observatory](https://observatory.db.erau.edu/) is part of the Department of Physical Sciences and is available to OSCOM to make observations of very dim objects. Being located in Daytona Beach, FL, it is extremely easy for OSCOM team members to mount instruments specifically for satellite observations---even at the last minute. This telescope collects four times as much light as the CDK20 and has several high quality wide field refractors co-mounted with the main 1 meter telescope.

### <a name="equipment-rasa"></a>Celestron RASA 11

The 11 inch Celestron Rowe Ackermann Schmidt Astrograph is a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) telescope uniquely capable of observing dim targets. Although much smaller, its fast f/2.2 optics deliver about the same number of photons per pixel as the CDK20 does for the same detector. This has become our primary instrument for unresolved satellite photometry and can easily be deployed to the field if necessary.

### Detectors

OSCOM has several fast CCD and CMOS detectors available for observations. These include Finger Lakes Instrumentation Microline and Lumenera SKYnyx CCDs, as well as the Allied Vision Manta G-235 using the Sony Pregius CMOS sensor.

Standard photometric filters including both UBVRI and u'g'r'i'z' are available for use on all of these detectors. IR pass and cut filters have also been used, especially for spatially resolved imaging.
