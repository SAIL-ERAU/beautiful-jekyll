## Geostationary Satellites

Satellites in geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) have an orbital period equal to Earth's rotational period, meaning they appear fixed in the same part of the sky from any given place on Earth. This orbit is especially convenient for large communication and weather satellites, but despite their size they appear as unresolved points---just like small satellites in LEO.

Overnight and seasonally the illumination geometry of GEO satellites changes so that observers on Earth see reflections off of different parts of the satellite. Tracking is trivial because the position of GEO satellites are fixed in the sky, but it is usually necessary to observe them over long periods of time for useful information on their physical state.

To create the video below, a RASA telescope was pointed at the EchoStar 16 satellite and the mount turned off. Stars move in the sky as Earth rotates while EchoStar 16 and the Rainbow-1 satellite, also in the field of view, remain stationary.

## Resolved Imaging

Large satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) are spatially resolved even when imaged through small aperture telescopes. The primary limitation to the resolution of ground-based satellite images is Earth's atmosphere; the motion of convective cells over an observing site blur the image. OSCOM utilizes several methods to combat atmospheric and other optical effects including speckle imaging and deconvolution.
