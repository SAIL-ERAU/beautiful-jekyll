title: Presentation at American Astronomical Society Meeting
subtitle: Sergei Bilardi presents High Cadence Photometry of the Tumbling Hitomi X-ray Satellite at 228th meeting of the AAS
---

OSCOM collected several high frame rate observations of the Japanese X-ray astronomy satellite _Hitomi_ (Astro-H) and several of its debris pieces after the spacecraft spun itself apart on March 26, 2016. An OSCOM team consisting of Forrest Gasdia, Sergei Bilardi, and Bert Kallio were able to collect photometric data at upwards of 350 samples per second over the course of a month from the break up. These data sets include simultaneous multi-color observations and simultaneous multi-site observations of the main Hitomi fragment and other debris pieces.

Several of the reduced light curves including a simultaneous multi-site observation was presented by Sergei Bilardi at the 228th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in San Diego, CA. An abstract of the presented work is available on [ADS](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AAS...22812103G).
