Student Forrest Gasdia's proposal titled _Surveying the Sky: An Aerospace Tracking System for Embry-Riddle's Astronomical Telescopes_ has been approved for Embry-Riddle internal funding in the amount of more than $5,000. Funds will be available between summer 2013 and 2014.

> _Surveying the Sky_ was the initial effort for an Aerospace Tracking System at Embry-Riddle and laid the foundation for OSCOM. Funds from the project provided software and fast CCD sensors that would produce the first satellite images from Creekside Observatory in Daytona Beach, FL.
