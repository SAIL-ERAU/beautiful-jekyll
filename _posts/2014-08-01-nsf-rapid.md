NSF RAPID award (#AGS-1450999) has provided seed funding for the OSCOM system.  This initial effort will provide student support for development of the system over 1 year and fund some equipment upgrades. The main observable for the original OSCOM effort is the NRL SpinSat small satellite, which is planned to be in orbit by January 2014.
